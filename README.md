# Asymptotic normality of simultaneous estimators of cyclic long-memory processes

This repository includes the Maple codes and R codes which were implemented to obtain the results of the research paper titled, "Asymptotic normality of simultaneous estimators of cyclic long-memory processes", see https://doi.org/10.1214/21-EJS1953.

## Abstract
Spectral singularities at non-zero frequencies play an important role in investigating cyclic or seasonal time series. The publication [2] introduced the generalized filtered method-of-moments approach to simultaneously estimate singularity location and long-memory parameters. This paper continues studies of these simultaneous estimators. A wide class of Gegenbauer-type semi-parametric models is considered. Asymptotic normality of several statistics of the cyclic and long-memory parameters is proved. New adjusted estimates are proposed and investigated. The theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical results. The methodology includes wavelet transformations as a particular case.
